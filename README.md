# DFXML Tools

A selection of tools I have authored that use the DFXML forensic data abstraction

* FlattenRegXML: Transform a standard RegXML document (previously created using the regxml_extractor project, or the hivexml tool) to a flattened RegXML document. (See: http://www.thomaslaurenson.com/dfxml-tools-flatten-regxml-reports/)

* HiveExtractor: Extract Windows Registry hive files using a DFXML report generated by the fiwalk tool. (See: http://www.thomaslaurenson.com/dfxml-tools-extracting-windows-registry-hive-files-using-fiwalk-and-dfxml/)

* Dir2DFXML. Create a DFXML report from a local directory. (See: http://www.thomaslaurenson.com/dfxml-tools-create-dfxml-report-from-local-directory/)

* SearchDFXML. Perform a keyword search on fileobjects from a DFXML report. (See: http://www.thomaslaurenson.com/dfxml-tools-create-dfxml-report-from-local-directory/)

* DFXML2sha1deep. Convert a DFXML report to a sha1deep hashset format. (See: http://www.thomaslaurenson.com/dfxml-tools-convert-dfxml-report-to-sha1deep-hashset/)
