# DFXML Tools

A selection of tools I have authored that use the DFXML forensic data abstraction

* FlattenRegXML: A simple script that transforms a standard RegXML document (previously created using the regxml_extractor project, or the hivexml tool) to a flattened RegXML document.

* HiveExtractor: A simple script that extracts Windows Registry hive files using a DFXML report generated by the fiwalk tool.
